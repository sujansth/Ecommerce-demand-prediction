# Ecommerce_demand_prediction

This is a final project for Data Science bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. 

This project is for the company top4sport which sells sports equipment across the EU. The goal of this project is to predict how many different items will be sold in the future for different periods of time.

# Technologies used
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Sklearn
* Fbprophet
* Long Short Term Memory (Recurrent Neural Network)
* ARIMA
etc.

# Project Description
This is a Time Series analysis (prediction) project to predict sales of various products across different platform. The historical data I have used is the sales data from June 2019 to Jan 2022. Here, I have started with the Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insignts on the dataset. Then for the prediction I have used various methods (and algorithms) to check which methods performs best. For instance, I have tried ARIMA model, Fbprophet and LSTM(Long Short Term Memory), out of which LSTM performed best with the RSME score of 163.
